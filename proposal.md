# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Stock Webscarper

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO
A stock webscraper that return information to the user regarding the stock and give it a rating whether or not to buy the stock.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO
I plan on doing a web scraper to find financial data probably from yahoo finance and possibly putting it within a CSV file. I also plan on creating an algorithm to rate whether you should buy a specific stock. If all goes well I also plan to include a stock prediction graph using panda.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO
A good outcome would consist of code that will be able to scrape the page that I want and return information about a given stock. I will be able to webscrape yahoo and return the information to the user no matter what.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO
A better outcome would consist of code that can scrape the page return information about a given stock and have an algorithm that rates whether or not you should buy the stock. I think I will be able to accomplish everything above and possibly creating a graph.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO
The best outcome would be everything above and having a graph that predicts stock prices. I hope to accomplish everything that I 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO
My next steps include starting to research how to webscrape and where to find the specific financial information that I will want to get. I think I will also have to learn how to use pandas for graphing and data. I will need to research creating an algorithm and some basic financial concepts.
